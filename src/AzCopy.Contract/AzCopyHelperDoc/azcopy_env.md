## azcopy env

Shows the environment variables that you can use to configure the behavior of AzCopy.

### Synopsis

Shows the environment variables that you can use to configure the behavior of AzCopy.

If you set an environment variable by using the command line, that variable will be readable in your command line history. Consider clearing variables that contain credentials from your command line history.  To keep variables from appearing in your history, you can use a script to prompt the user for their credentials, and to set the environment variable.

```
azcopy env [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help             help for env
      --show-sensitive   Shows sensitive/secret environment variables.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --cap-mbps float                      Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.
      --output-type string                  Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")
      --trusted-microsoft-suffixes string   Specifies additional domain suffixes where Azure Active Directory login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
