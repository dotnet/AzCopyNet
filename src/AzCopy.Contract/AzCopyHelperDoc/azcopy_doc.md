      --output-type string                  Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")

The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
