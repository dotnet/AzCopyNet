## azcopy bench

Performs a performance benchmark

### Synopsis


Runs a performance benchmark by uploading or downloading test data to or from a specified destination. 
For uploads, the test data is automatically generated.

The benchmark command runs the same process as 'copy', except that: 

  - Instead of requiring both source and destination parameters, benchmark takes just one. This is the 
    blob container, Azure Files Share, or ADLS Gen 2 File System that you want to upload to or download from.

  - The 'mode' parameter describes whether AzCopy should test uploads to or downloads from given target. Valid values are 'Upload'
    and 'Download'. Default value is 'Upload'.

  - For upload benchmarks, the payload is described by command line parameters, which control how many files are auto-generated and 
    how big they are. The generation process takes place entirely in memory. Disk is not used.

  - For downloads, the payload consists of whichever files already exist at the source. (See example below about how to generate
    test files if needed).
  
  - Only a few of the optional parameters that are available to the copy command are supported.
  
  - Additional diagnostics are measured and reported.
  
  - For uploads, the default behaviour is to delete the transferred data at the end of the test run.  For downloads, the data
    is never actually saved locally.

Benchmark mode will automatically tune itself to the number of parallel TCP connections that gives 
the maximum throughput. It will display that number at the end. To prevent auto-tuning, set the 
AZCOPY_CONCURRENCY_VALUE environment variable to a specific number of connections. 

All the usual authentication types are supported. However, the most convenient approach for benchmarking upload is typically
to create an empty container with a SAS token and use SAS authentication. (Download mode requires a set of test data to be
present in the target container.)

### Examples

```
Run an upload benchmark with default parameters (suitable for benchmarking networks up to 1 Gbps):'

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>"

Run a benchmark test that uploads 100 files, each 2 GiB in size: (suitable for benchmarking on a fast network, e.g. 10 Gbps):'

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 100 --size-per-file 2G

Same as above, but use 50,000 files, each 8 MiB in size and compute their MD5 hashes (in the same way that the --put-md5 flag does this
in the copy command). The purpose of --put-md5 when benchmarking is to test whether MD5 computation affects throughput for the 
selected file count and size:

   - azcopy bench --mode='Upload' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 50000 --size-per-file 8M --put-md5

Run a benchmark test that downloads existing files from a target

   - azcopy bench --mode='Download' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS?"

Run an upload that does not delete the transferred files. (These files can then serve as the payload for a download test)

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 100 --delete-test-data=false

```

### Options

```
      --blob-type string         defines the type of blob at the destination. Used to allow benchmarking different blob types. Identical to the same-named parameter in the copy command (default "Detect")
      --block-size-mb float      use this block size (specified in MiB). Default is automatically calculated based on file size. Decimal fractions are allowed - e.g. 0.25. Identical to the same-named parameter in the copy command
      --check-length             Check the length of a file on the destination after the transfer. If there is a mismatch between source and destination, the transfer is marked as failed. (default true)
      --delete-test-data         if true, the benchmark data will be deleted at the end of the benchmark run.  Set it to false if you want to keep the data at the destination - e.g. to use it for manual tests outside benchmark mode (default true)
      --file-count uint          number of auto-generated data files to use (default 100)
  -h, --help                     help for bench
      --mode string              Defines if Azcopy should test uploads or downloads from this target. Valid values are 'upload' and 'download'. Defaulted option is 'upload'. (default "upload")
      --number-of-folders uint   If larger than 0, create folders to divide up the data.
      --put-md5                  create an MD5 hash of each file, and save the hash as the Content-MD5 property of the destination blob/file. (By default the hash is NOT created.) Identical to the same-named parameter in the copy command
      --size-per-file string     size of each auto-generated data file. Must be a number immediately followed by K, M or G. E.g. 12k or 200G (default "250M")
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --cap-mbps float                      Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.
      --log-level string                    Define the log verbosity for the log file, available levels: INFO(all requests/responses), WARNING(slow responses), ERROR(only failed requests), and NONE(no output logs). (default 'INFO'). (default "INFO")
      --output-level string                 Define the output verbosity. Available levels: essential, quiet. (default "default")
      --output-type string                  Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")
      --trusted-microsoft-suffixes string   Specifies additional domain suffixes where Azure Active Directory login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net;*.storage.azure.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
